//   #MODE lines: name of the language scheme
//                anything after this name is ignored
//   #TAG lines : name of the sub-category in the language scheme
//                anything after this name is ignored
//   other regular lines: list of keywords
//                        each line contains the keywords starting with the same initial letter
//                        lines are ordered alphabetically (not mandatory for the parser, but
//                        helps readability and error-checking)
