<p><b>ode_optional_output</b> -  ode solvers optional outputs description</p>
<h3><font color="blue">Description</font></h3>
      This page describes the the most important values returned in the
      optional lhs <a href="../../../../../../home/jpc/Download/scicoslab/man/fr/nonlinear/ode.htm"><tt><b>ode</b></tt></a> function arguments <tt><b>w</b></tt> and
      <tt><b>iw</b></tt>.
      These are valid only for the <tt><b>lsode</b></tt><tt><b>lsoda</b></tt> and  <tt><b>lsodar</b></tt> ode solver.
	For more details, one can look at the solvers fortran code comments in <tt><b>routines/integ/lsod*.f</b></tt>.
      <dl>
<dd>
<b>w(11)</b> the step size in t last used (successfully).</dd>
<dd>
<b>w(12)</b> the step size to be attempted on the next step.</dd>
<dd>
<b>w(13)</b> the current value of the independent variable
	    which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
	    current internal mesh point in t.  on output, tcur
	    will always be at least as far as the argument
	    t, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).</dd>
<dd>
<b>w(14)</b> a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
	    computed when a request for too much accuracy was
	    detected (istate = -3 if detected at the start of
	    the problem, istate = -2 otherwise).  if itol is
	    left unaltered but rtol and atol are uniformly
	    scaled up by a factor of <tt><b>tolsf=w(14)</b></tt> for the next call,
	    then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
	    (the user may also ignore <tt><b>tolsf</b></tt> and alter the
	    tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)</dd>
<dd>
<b>w(15)</b> the value of t at the time of the last method
	    switch, if any. This value is not significant with
	    <tt><b>lsode</b></tt> solver. </dd>
<dd>
<b>iw(10)</b> the number of <tt><b>g</b></tt>  evaluations for the problem so
	    far. This value is only significant for <tt><b>lsodar</b></tt> solver.</dd>
<dd>
<b>iw(11)</b> the number of steps taken for the problem so far.</dd>
<dd>
<b>iw(12)</b> the number of f evaluations for the problem so far.</dd>
<dd>
<b>iw(13)</b> the number of jacobian evaluations (and of matrix
	    lu decompositions) for the problem so far.</dd>
<dd>
<b>iw(14)</b> the method order last used (successfully).</dd>
<dd>
<b>iw(15)</b> the order to be attempted on the next step.</dd>
<dd>
<b>iw(16)</b> the index of the component of largest magnitude in
	    the weighted local error vector ( e(i)/ewt(i) ),
	    on an error return with istate = -4 or -5.</dd>
<dd>
<b>iw(17)</b> the length of <tt><b>w</b></tt> actually required, assuming
	    that the length of rwork is to be fixed for the
	    rest of the problem, and that switching may occur.
	    this is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
	    input return for insufficient storage.</dd>
<dd>
<b>iw(18)</b> the length of <tt><b>iw</b></tt> actually required, assuming
	    that the length of <tt><b>iw</b></tt> is to be fixed for the
	    rest of the problem, and that switching may occur.
	    this is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
	    input return for insufficient storage.</dd>
<dd>
<b>iw(19)</b> the method indicator for the last successful step..
	    1 means adams (nonstiff), 2 means bdf (stiff). This value is not significant with
	    <tt><b>lsode</b></tt> solver.</dd>
<dd>
<b>iw(20)</b> the current method indicator..
	    1 means adams (nonstiff), 2 means bdf (stiff).
	    this is the method to be attempted
	    on the next step.  thus it differs from <tt><b>iw(19)</b></tt>
	    only if a method switch has just been made. This value is not significant with
	    <tt><b>lsode</b></tt> solver.</dd>
