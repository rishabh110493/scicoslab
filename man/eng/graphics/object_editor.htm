<h3><font color="blue">Description</font></h3>
<p>As explained in the <tt><b>graphics_entities</b></tt> help file, Scilab
    graphics is now based on a brent new graphics mode. This mode allows the
    user to have more interaction with graphics before and after having them
    drawn. In the <tt><b>"new"</b></tt> mode, each graphics window and the
    drawing it contains are represented by hierchical entities. The hierachy
    top level is the Figure. Each Figure defines at least one child of type
    Axes. Each Axes entity contains a set of leaf entities which are the basic
    graphics objects like Polylines, Rectangles, Arcs, Segs,... It can also
    contain a Compound type which are recursive sets of entities.</p>
<p>The main interest of the new graphic mode is to make property changes
    easier. This new graphics'mode provides a set of high-level graphing
    routines (see <a href="../../../../../../home/jpc/Download/scicoslab/man/eng/graphics/set.htm"><tt><b>set</b></tt></a>, <a href="../../../../../../home/jpc/Download/scicoslab/man/eng/graphics/get.htm"><tt><b>get</b></tt></a>) used to control objects'
    properties such as data, coordinates and scaling, color and appearences
    without requiring to replay the initial graphics commands.</p>
<p>Graphics entities are associated to Scilab variables of type
    <tt><b>handle</b></tt>. The handle is a unique identifier which is associated
    to each instance of a created graphical entity. Using this handle, it will
    be possible to reach entities' properties through "set" and "get"
    routines. The handles are also used to manipulate graphics objects, to
    move them, to make copies or delete them.</p>
<p>To complete and use the graphics handle capacity at its maximum, a
    graphic object editor has been created too. It is a set of Tcl/Tk
    interfaces available for each kind of graphics objects (see
    <a href="../../../../../../home/jpc/Download/scicoslab/man/eng/graphics/graphics_entities.htm"><tt><b>graphics_entities</b></tt></a> for more details) that can be enabled for
    each graphic window. To make it work, select the <tt><b>Edit</b></tt> menu in
    the graphic window. Seven graphics editing operations are available :</p>
<p></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<b>Select figure as current: </b>Let thisfigure be the current one.<p></p>
</dd>
<dd>
<b>Redraw figure: </b>Redraw the content of the graphics window (only useful for
        old_style mode).<p></p>
</dd>
<dd>
<b>Erase figure: </b>Erase the content of the graphics window. Its action corresponds
        to a <tt><b>xbasc</b></tt> (old graphic style) or <tt><b>clf</b></tt> (new
        graphic style) command.<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The last eight items are specially dedicated to the graphic editor
        :</p>
<p></p>
</dd>
<dd>
<b>Copy object: </b>Using the mouse, it allows the user to select a 2D object (like a
        curve, a rectangle...) and put it in the clipboard. Thus, by a next
        call to <tt><b>Paste object</b></tt>, the object is copied in the
        selected current axes.<p></p>
</dd>
<dd>
<b>Paste object: </b>Allow the user to paste a previous object put into in the
        clipboard inside the selected current axes.<p></p>
</dd>
<dd>
<b>Move object: </b>Using the mouse, it allows the user to move a 2D object (like a
        curve, a rectangle...) inside the selected current axes.<p></p>
</dd>
<dd>
<b>Delete object: </b>Using the mouse, it allows the user to pick up a 2D object (like a
        curve, a rectangle...) inside the selected current axes and to delete
        it instantly.<p></p>
</dd>
<dd>
<b>Figure Properties: </b>Launch the Tcl/Tk interface for the Figure object applied to the
        figure handle of the graphics window.<p></p>
</dd>
<dd>
<b>Current Axes Properties: </b>Launch the Tcl/Tk interface for the Axes object applied to the
        current axes handle of the graphics window.<p></p>
</dd>
<dd>
<b>Start Entity Picker: </b>Start an event handler on the graphics window to catch the mouse
        clicks on graphics objects and launch the corresponding Tcl/Tk
        interface. The left mouse-click allows object edition and the right
        click performs a move of the selected object. Note that, for now, this
        feature is applied to 2D objects only.<p></p>
</dd>
<dd>
<b>Stop Entity Picker: </b>Stop the action of the Entity Picker by terminating the event
        handler on the graphics window.<p></p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Once the graphic interface is enabled (using the <tt><b>Figure
    Properties</b></tt> or <tt><b>Current Axes Properties</b></tt> options), two
    main areas appear :</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<dl><dd>
<b>A tree selector: </b>Placed on the left side of the graphical editor, a hierarchical
        tree selector specifies which object is currently edited. It can be
        used to switch from a graphic object to another provided that they are
        in the same graphic window.</dd></dl>
<p><IMG ALIGN="CENTERED" src="../../images/graphics/tree.gif"></p>
<p></p>
<dl><dd>
<b>A notebook: </b>The second area represents a notebook composed with different
        properties pages (like <tt><b>Style</b></tt>, <tt><b>Data</b></tt>,
        <tt><b>Clipping</b></tt>...) depending on the selected graphic object.
        Using this editor, man can edit more easily the whole properties set
        of each graphic object (like through the <tt><b>"set"</b></tt> and
        <tt><b>"get"</b></tt> commands). Here is an example of the axes' notebook
        displaying axes properties:</dd></dl>
