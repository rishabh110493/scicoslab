<h3><font color="blue">Description</font></h3>
<p>
    PT_ij ((i,j)-entry of matrix PT) is the processing time of part j by machine i
    (T_ij = -inf if part j does not visit machine i) in a flowshop
    (in a flowshop, as opposed to a jobshop, all parts visit machines in
    the increasing order of the machine numbers with the possibility of skipping
    some machines). 
  </p>
<p>
    nm is a vector with size equal to the PT row number: it yields
    the numbers of machines of each type working in parallel.
  </p>
<p>
    np is a vector of size equal to the PT column number: it yields the numbers
    of pallets of each type (parts of each type are carried by specialized
    pallets).
  </p>
<p>
    Given this data,  flowshop_graph:
  </p>
<p>
    -  builds a flowshop graph (g) (metanet graph-list) depicting the corresponding
    cyclic flowshop (where it is assumed that as soon as machines and pallets have
    finished with all tasks of a cycle, they start another cycle),
  </p>
<p>
    -  builds a maxplus matrix of the timings (T) for the corresponding event
    graph, Tkl contains the processing time of edge from k to l where the
    states corresponds here tp couples (i,j).
  </p>
<p>
    -  builds a maxplus matrix of the initial markings (N) for the corresponding
    event graph, Nkl contains the initial marking of edge from k to l.
  </p>
<p>
    - plots the flowshop in a metanet window.
  </p>
<p>
    PT must not have a row or a column identical to -inf.
  </p>
<p>
    Remarks: 
  </p>
<p>
    Some nodes  are duplicated artificially to see the system
    as an input-output system with  feedback.
    Then red nodes may considered as input nodes (U), green nodes
    as  output nodes and the feedback as the identity (Y=U).
  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
    The black edge weights are processing times, the blue are resource
    (machine or pallet numbers). The yellow edges (feedback) have 0
    processing time and 0 resource.
  </p>
<p>
    The arc weights (processing time or resource number) are 
    in the "edge_length" field (called flow in menus) of the graph-list g
    because either the processing time or the resource number 
    is 0 in this modelling, and, by this way, no manipulations
    are necessary to visualize these quantities in metanet.
