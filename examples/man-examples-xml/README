In this directory we show how to customize Scilab help by 
adding two new sections. This should work on windows 
and unix 

Directories "helpdir1" and "helpdir2" contain 
Scilab xml files for each new section.

By running the builder.sce script a set of html files are generated. 
You need to have sabcmd command 
installed on your machine and present in your path. 
(see http://www.gingerall.com/charlie/ga/xml/p_sab.xml)

Running the scilab script loader.sce will add the two directories 
helpdir1 and helpdir2 in your help Scilab help browser 

The generated files sciman.hh* can be used by 
HTML Help Workshop (HHW.exe) to produce a compressed html 
file sciman.chm 
The runtime (HH.exe) can be used to run the generated sciman.chm 
(http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/author/htmlhelp/)
