This directory contains example of a mix of C interface routines and  
C and Fortran mex files. More over the interfaces and mex functions 
use symbols defined in a shared library lib/libutil.so defined 
in the lib subdirectory. 
This should only work with scilab version build after oct 2001 
(i.e it should not work with scilab-2.6 and older versions)

just type make to build the shared libraries 
and make tests to run a test
