How to create a library of Scilab functions
*******************************************
1-Put all your .sci files in a directory
2-Edit the Makefile given here and set the variables:
SCIDIR    (the Scilab directory)
NAM       (the name of the library e.g. NAM = library-name)
NAME      (the pathname of the directory containing the .sci files)
MACROS    (the list of .sci files to be inserted in the library)
3-make    (two files "names' and "lib" are created; names is an ascii file
           containing the names of the functions; lib is a binary file
           containing the code of the scilab functions).  
4-load the library into Scilab by the command: load("lib") 
Within Scilab, the content of the library is obtained by typing
the name of the library.

Aternatively you can use the command: lib("pathname-of-the-library")
Scilab will load the needed functions from the "names" file.
