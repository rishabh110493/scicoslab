	We provide here two interfaces intview.c and intmatmul.c.
	They are used to add two function view and matmul at Scilab level. 
	A shared library tutorial.so is built and loading this 
	shared library in Scilab will add view and matmul

[1] How to make the library run 
	jum to next section at number 2

[2] How to adapt the code for your functions
	0 - Write your interface program (see intmatmul.c and intview.c)
	1 - Edit the builder.sce file and customize it according.
	2 - at the Scilab prompt --> enter "exec builder.sce"

	3 - Then to load the library, at the Scilab prompt --> enter 
		exec loader.sce
	(Note that you can load the library from an other directory)
	4 - Use the new function e.g. 
		-->AB=matmul(ones(2,2),ones(2,2))
	5 - change tutorial.tst (and rename it if you have changed the library
		name in builder.sce 
	    at Scilab prompt type make tests to run tutorial.tst
    	The first time you run make tests whith a changed tutorial.tst,
	the generated file tutorial.dia will differ from tutorial.dia.ref. 
        Manually check tutorial.dia, if it is ok copy it to tutorial.dia.ref 
    
[3] How to run the contents of this directory as a test

	make distclean 
	make tests 
	should perform steps 2.2 to 2.4 automatically
