The directory contains scilab function which emulate some matlab
functions to complex for an inline translation. 

Translator often uses these functions when it cannot determine type or
dimensions of some crucial args. These function allows translated
functions to work, but it is often simple and much more efficient to
replace the call to these function by the correponding scilab
code. See code of these function to have the scilab equivalents.


The functions which name begin with a percent are used to emulate
operations between boolean and regular matrices (see overloading)
