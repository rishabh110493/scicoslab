BUGS (# = open, * = fixed, ?=dont know)
=======================================

#001 - text labels of some mechanical block icons are not fully
       visible in Scicos editor

*002 - text labels in icons are not (correctly?) flipped

#003 - label of BodyRadiation doesn't show parameter value
       (this is NOT considered a bug of Coselica, because it's 
        actually a deficiency of MSL 2.2)

*004 - VariableInductor, VariableCapacitor do not compile,
       because of "assert", which is not supported by scicos'
       modelica compiler

*005 - GUI function of VariableInductor uses a parameter named
       "I"  instead of "L"

*006 - BodyRadiation does not compile because of missing
       Modelica.Constants.sigma

*007 - changing the parameter "exact" in Translational.Position,
       Rotational.Position, and Rotational.Speed has no effect.
       Currently this behaviour is intended, the input signal is always
       filtered, assuming that the input signal is usually supplied by a
       non-modelica, i.e. ordinary causal, scicos block.

#008 - icon graphics of most (but not all) Modelica.Blocks.* should not be
       flipped

*009 - typo/error in macros/Blocks/Interfaces/buildmacros.sce

*010 - graphics.in_implicit/graphics.out_implicit in all GUI functions
       should be set to 'E', this will give the user are more familiar
       diagram editing experience

#011 - trying to start a link at "graphically explicit" (see BUG 010) 
       input ports provokes a error message like

         I recovered from the following error:
         invalid index
         in SmartLink_ action.

       in the ScicosLab shell window. This happens for MEAI_IdealClosingSwitch
       and some others ...

       Currently it is not clear, whether this a bug of Coselica or a bug/flaw of
       ScicosLab?

*012  output "port" of Modelica.Thermal.HeatTransfer.PrescribedTemperature
      should be marked as implicit ("I") for the scicos editor

#013  steadyStartState in HeatCapacitor is useless because initial equations
      are not supported by scicoslab 4.3

#014  example/test TranslationalForcedMovement is broken, simulation fails
      at approx. t=7.31s

*015 Planar.Sensors.{AbsAngle,AbsAngularVelocity,AbsAngularAcceleration} are
     not working

*016 Planar.Force.LineForce is a complete disaster, DO NOT USE it!!!

?017 provide initialization parameters only for block w/ states, i.e.
     remove it from Planar.Parts.{Body,BodyShape}

#018 parameter "s_small" in Planar.Sensors.Distance has no effect, i.e.
    prevention of zero-division is not implemented

#019 MTH_HeatCapacitor raises on 'set' job a run-time error, this has been
     manually fixed only (line 39 : "list('vec',1,'vec',1,'vec',1),exprs);" )

#020 cos_list: wrong lookups for simple model names, e.g. there is no
     model "Inductor" only "Modelica.Electrical.Basic.Inductor".
     Possible solutions:
       - quick&dirty: assume always clean formatting and look for leading spaces 
       - proper: analyze tree structure => model is part of which package?

#021 most icons of Rotational.Sources.* w/ bearing flange are not looking
     good, especially when flipped

*022 electrical PowerSensor doesn't work

#023 unit of parameter "duration" in setup dialog of
     Modelica.Blocks.Sources.Ramp should be "[s]" and not "[-]"
