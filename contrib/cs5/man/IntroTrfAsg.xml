  <DESCRIPTION>
  <P>
     The purpose of the toolbox is to solve traffic assignment problems. A good reference is Michael Patriksson&apos;s book &quot;The Traffic Assignment Problem, Models and
    Methods&quot;.

    1) The Traffic Network : an oriented graph G where nn nodes represent places or cities, and na arcs represent  links or roads.
  </DESCRIPTION_ITEM>

  <DESCRIPTION_ITEM  label=''> 
    2) The Link Performance Functions (also known as travel time functions): the travel time as a function of the flow in the arc. Seven formulae are used needing 4 parameters. Once a formula is chosen for the whole network, the parameters are defined in a 4 x na matrix.

  <DESCRIPTION_ITEM  label=''> 
    3) The Origin-Destination traffic demand pairs (OD-pairs also called commodities) : are given by an initial node, a final node and a flow. The nd OD-pairs are defined by a 3 x nd matrix.

     All the data is stored in a scilab structure called a &quot;NetList&quot; that plays the role of a geographic data basis which can be visualized by &quot;ShowNet&quot; and edited inside &quot;metanet&quot; or &quot;scigraph&quot;. This NetList is build by &quot;MakeNet&quot;.

    The traffic assignment is computed by &quot;TrafficAssig&quot;. The results are stored in the Geographic Data Basis and can be visualized with &quot;ShowNet&quot;.
