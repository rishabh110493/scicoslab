  <p>
     The purpose of the toolbox is to solve traffic assignment problems. A good reference is Michael Patriksson's book "The Traffic Assignment Problem, Models and
    Methods".
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
    To define the problem we need :
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
 

  <li><b></b> 
    1) The Traffic Network : an oriented graph G where nn nodes represent places or cities, and na arcs represent  links or roads.
  </li>

  <li><b></b> 
    2) The Link Performance Functions (also known as travel time functions): the travel time as a function of the flow in the arc. Seven formulae are used needing 4 parameters. Once a formula is chosen for the whole network, the parameters are defined in a 4 x na matrix.
  </li>

  <li><b></b> 
    3) The Origin-Destination traffic demand pairs (OD-pairs also called commodities) : are given by an initial node, a final node and a flow. The nd OD-pairs are defined by a 3 x nd matrix.
  </li>

     All the data is stored in a scilab structure called a "NetList" that plays the role of a geographic data basis which can be visualized by "ShowNet" and edited inside "metanet" or "scigraph". This NetList is build by "MakeNet".
  </p><p>
     
  </p><p>
    The traffic assignment is computed by "TrafficAssig". The results are stored in the Geographic Data Basis and can be visualized with "ShowNet".
