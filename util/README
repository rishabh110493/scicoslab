 This directory contains utility functions:

- An example of calling scilab as a subroutine of a user's main program
=======================================================================    
    * callsci.f: Fortran main program. This main program send matrices 
                (call matz) and commands (call scirun) to scilab and 
                 gets the results back (call matz).

    * Makefile: is a makefile usable to generate executable associated to
                callsci.f 

    * Makefile.in: source file used by SCIDIR/Makefile to create
                   Makefile file

    * sci2for.f Fortran routines used by sci2for translator

- Scilab utility shell scripts
==============================
    * scicomp generates a .bin file correspondig to a scilab function
         ascii .sci file	

    * scidem executes a batch scilab instructions file.

    * scidoc used for documentation generation

    * scilib generates a binary file containing the image of a scilab
      library
